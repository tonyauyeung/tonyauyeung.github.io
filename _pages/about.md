Hi there 👋. I'm _Tony Ruikang OuYang_ (_歐陽瑞康_ in Chinese; _SeoiHong AuYeung_ pronounced in Cantonese). I'm now a research assistant in Machine Learning 🤖 at the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/about.html), University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org). Recently, I completed my **MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence** from the University of Cambridge 🎉. My MPhil thesis focus on energy-based models and neural sampler for sampling from Boltzmann distribution, which is supervised by [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org). Prior to that, I finished my **BEng in Data Science** in Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz) and spent a wonderful year exchanging in the University of Oxford studying Mathematics and Statistics (fully-funded by HITsz).

My current research interests include <u>generative models</u>, <u>neural samplers</u>, and their applications to <u>molecular generation</u> 🧬. Generally, I'm interested in <u>probabilistic machine learning</u> and <u>AI4S</u>, especially developing powerful, efficient and scalable methods that can applied to physics ⚛️ and biochemistry 🧪.
